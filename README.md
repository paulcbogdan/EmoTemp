## Emotional dissociations in temporal associations

This repository contains the data and Python code for the paper, "Emotional Dissociations in Temporal Associations: Opposing Effects of Arousal on Memory for Details Surrounding Unpleasant Events" (2023) by Bogdan, P.C., Dolcos, S., Federmeier, F.D., Lleras, A., Schwarb, H., Dolcos, F. to be published in *Cognition and Emotion*.

The `EmoTemp_replication_data.csv` provides the data needed to reproduce the Replication Study results reported. This includes both the results in the manuscript (on corrected accuracy and false alarm rates) and the results in the supplemental materials (on sensitivity and criterion scores).

To run the analysis and generate the bar graphs, run `analysis.py`. The figures will be output to `figs_out`.
